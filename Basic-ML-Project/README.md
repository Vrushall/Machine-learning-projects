Overview

This project explores and compares different machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest, using hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall to determine their effectiveness.

Models Used

-Logistic Regression (L1 & L2 Regularization)

-Random Forest Classifier

Key Features

-Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

-Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, and Recall

-Comparison of L1 vs. L2 regularization in Logistic Regression

-Feature importance analysis

-Performance visualization using confusion matrices
