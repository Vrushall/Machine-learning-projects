# Machine-learning-projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on during my academic journey and beyond. These projects cover various machine-learning techniques, including regression, classification and model optimization. Each project is organized into its own folder with the corresponding code, data (if applicable), and a description of the problem, approach, and findings.
